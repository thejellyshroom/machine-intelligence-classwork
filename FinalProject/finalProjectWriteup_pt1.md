# Final Project Part 1

## Domain

The future of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in preschool education lies in generative conversational storytelling, designed to collaborate with young children. As educational startups increasingly integrate AI into their products, this space is witnessing a surge in creative storytelling tools. Examples include AI-assisted Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) campaigns and AI-driven character personifications. With ongoing instructor shortages in early education, there is a growing demand for teaching tools that can engage children effectively, while also tailoring educational content and storytelling to meet each child's unique needs. Generative AI has the potential to disrupt this domain by offering personalized, interactive, and imaginative learning experiences for young learners.

## Dataset & Attributes

### [ajibawa-2023/Children-Stories-Collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajibawa-2023/Children-Stories-Collection/viewer/default/train?views%5B%5D=train)

This Hugging Face dataset contains approximately 0.9 million stories specifically curated for young children. It provides a rich resource for training large language models to generate child-friendly stories.

The data is structured in "prompt" and "text" pairs, making it suitable for training generative models.
The total token length is included, enabling efficient preprocessing and model optimization.
The dataset comprises 10 separate JSON files, allowing flexibility in selecting subsets or using the entire collection for training purposes.

The stories are tailored to young audiences, making them ideal for generating educational and engaging content aligned with course materials. This dataset provides the foundational material needed to train AI systems capable of creating personalized, interactive stories that cater to children's developmental and educational requirements.
